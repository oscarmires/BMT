# Clipping Experiments

Experimentation of the BMT-Clipping solution model. This directory contains notebooks where each of the experiments is explained in detail.

We named each experiment after different sections in our technical report (4.1, 4.2, ...). Please ignore this names since we stoped linking each experiment to a specific section of the report. Experiments "4.1" and "4.2 "are discussed in section 4.1 of the technical report. Experiments "4.3", "4.4" and "4.5" are discussed in section 4.2 of the technical report.
